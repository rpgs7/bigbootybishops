<p>Our dear bard! Dissing rats to death, reciting slam poetry, renditions of ‘Waterdeep’ and inventing new dance crazes - she’s always good for entertainment! Unexpectedly seems to have found herself as a “sensible one” of the party.
Something tells me the surprise means she wasn’t always the sensible one in her…er…however many years (she hits me when I ask).</p>
