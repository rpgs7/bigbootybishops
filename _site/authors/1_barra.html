<p>What luck we have to have this… unique individual trailblazing through our adventures. Both our meat shield and our menace. Not the sharpest spoon in the oven but happy to sow chaos and I usually like the fun that’s left in that chaos’ wake!
Best hope eggs are not in short supply, else Jonathan may be paying you a visit. I wouldn’t worry about that though, you’ll hear him coming a mile off with his new farty boots.</p>
