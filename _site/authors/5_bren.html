<p>Goes by many names, Brinn, Bryyyn, Bren, Bran, and more. (Former?) mercenary who joined the gang one night looking for coin alongside Kaya. Clearly the trip to get some mushroom wine was moreish as they’ve merrily stuck around since! He’s had a “brush with Bhall” as my papa used to say (a deity of death/murder), and has shown interest in Ander’s domain - no sign of leaving the coinlust behind though.
Personally, I think he’d be better off with Sune, maybe with a deity of love and beauty on his side he’d have more luck with the ladies. Like I’m one to talk…</p>
