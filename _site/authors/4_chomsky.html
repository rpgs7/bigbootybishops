<p>Hmmm, what to say about me… Accidental voluntary “orphan”, poorly-adjusted to societal norms resulting in actions that can cause concern, but generally well meaning. Eat the rich. That’ll do. Self-awareness is the first step to improvement, they say! I’m supposed to be the sneaky one but Scampi, my mouse, often outshines me in that department - please give him cheese.</p>
