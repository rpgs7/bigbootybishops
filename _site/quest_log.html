      <div class = "innerContent">
        After dealing with the threat in Kvaldir, we came across a magical stone that likely ignited Kvaldir's woes and would then become our biggest woe...
        <br></br>
        <ul class = "fa-ul">
          
            <li class = "listGold"><span class="fa-li"><i class="fas fa-caret-right"></i></span>During the Kvaldir celebrations, Chomsky noticed a young dwarf acting suspicious and tailed him. He turned out to be Ordnar, the Jarl's (Kvaldir's fallen ruler) son.</li>
          
            <li class = "listGold"><span class="fa-li"><i class="fas fa-caret-right"></i></span>In following him to Lodar's study, Chomsky discovered the stone, once protected by a magical material that Ordnar accidentally broke, which co-incided with the adverse events.</li>
          
            <li class = "listGold"><span class="fa-li"><i class="fas fa-caret-right"></i></span>Corners of the Circle were a group that formerly protected the stone, and Feywind was one of its members. Protected mainly against an evil group named The Night Parade.</li>
          
            <li class = "listGold"><span class="fa-li"><i class="fas fa-caret-right"></i></span>We opted to take the stone to safeguard it, uncertain of where to take the stone. Touri identified the stone as one that allows opening gates to other planes, and is easily tracable without its protective barrier - almost acting like a beacon.</li>
          
            <li class = "listGold"><span class="fa-li"><i class="fas fa-caret-right"></i></span>Upon returning to Waterdeep, a strange figure, Balthazar, visited Trollskull Manor.</li>
          
            <li class = "listGold"><span class="fa-li"><i class="fas fa-caret-right"></i></span>Balthazar wanted to purchase the stone from us, willing to pay 20,000g. He gave off a bad vibe and wouldn't say what he planned to do with the stone.</li>
          
            <li class = "listGold"><span class="fa-li"><i class="fas fa-caret-right"></i></span>We tried to find Mirt from the Harpers to discuss what to do, to no avail. Around the same time, Chomsky received a package from Ordnar, in which there was a journal belonging to Feywind.</li>
          
            <li class = "listGold"><span class="fa-li"><i class="fas fa-caret-right"></i></span>The journal contained a spell which Hilde (Ordnar's mother) believed may lead us to Feywind. As the Corners of the Circle protected the stone before, he was a lead in how to protect it again.</li>
          
            <li class = "listGold"><span class="fa-li"><i class="fas fa-caret-right"></i></span>We discovered the spell was a teleportation spell, and so took it to Thorgen. Who opened a portal, and the Bishops entered.</li>
          
            <li class = "listGold"><span class="fa-li"><i class="fas fa-caret-right"></i></span>When getting through, the Bishops arrived in an open street, orange lanterns lit the area and merchant stalls all around - being being ambushed by The Night Parade.</li>
          
            <li class = "listGold"><span class="fa-li"><i class="fas fa-caret-right"></i></span>After fighting them off, we approached a figure in the distance, a lady by the pond at the end of the road - who opened another portal for us, which we again entered.</li>
          
            <li class = "listGold"><span class="fa-li"><i class="fas fa-caret-right"></i></span>Arriving in a serene forest area, we came across a a beautiful marble building - a bath-house; The Restful Lily! We are welcomed by a beautiful moon elf who takes us in to offer treatments and relaxation!</li>
          
            <li class = "listGold"><span class="fa-li"><i class="fas fa-caret-right"></i></span>When swimming, we encouter a Naiad water spirit, suspicions on the proprieters arise and Ander uses Detect Magic to discover its all a ruse, by fiends and hags - a battle ensues.</li>
          
            <li class = "listGold"><span class="fa-li"><i class="fas fa-caret-right"></i></span>After defeating the evil, the Bishops search the premises, finding a cursed kobold who informs us of cursed portraits - we come across a tower out back, and searching it we find two withering, dying people.</li>
          
            <li class = "listGold"><span class="fa-li"><i class="fas fa-caret-right"></i></span>We find the portraits and destroy them, lifting the curse of several people, including Feywind. We tell him we require his help once he was fit, to guard the stone.</li>
          
            <li class = "listGold"><span class="fa-li"><i class="fas fa-caret-right"></i></span>Feywind doesn't have his spellbook, and suggests heading to Silverymoon to deal with the stone. After a brief blip of battling ogres, we reach Silverymoon and Feywind looks skittish.</li>
          
            <li class = "listGold"><span class="fa-li"><i class="fas fa-caret-right"></i></span>We agree to meet him at a tavern later in the day, wondering whether he'll show. He does, accompanied by Mirt, from The Harpers. Who after long discussion, we allow to safeguard the stone in their vault in the College of Lore.</li>
