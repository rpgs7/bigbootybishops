<meta name="description" content="Volothamp &quot;Volo&quot; Geddarm Well known author, well known charlatan - but a friendly face all the same. Couldn&#39;t quite pay up for us saving his fancyman, but it got us this big ol&#39; manor and a lead on the missing money from the former Open Lord of Waterdeep who nicked a very very handsome sum... Feywind Wine wizard, one of the founders of Corners of the Circle, and all round feckin enigma. Good at gambling, bad at being a muse for a painting. Met shades of him in pocket dimensions where he&#39;s been a tit; now that we&#39;ve met him in person? Still a tit. Erky Timbers A stout-hearted little halfling, guided by Torm, or... another god, Pelor? I can&#39;t remember, and neither can he. He&#39;s a good lad. Has to be - he&#39;s a Timbers! We originally found him way back in the Sunless Citadel. Mirt Notable member of The Harpers, fancies Tilion to join them. Cropped up in Waterdeep as well as Silverymoon. Don&#39;t know too much about him but he likes his opera and he looks like he likes his food - alright in my book." />
