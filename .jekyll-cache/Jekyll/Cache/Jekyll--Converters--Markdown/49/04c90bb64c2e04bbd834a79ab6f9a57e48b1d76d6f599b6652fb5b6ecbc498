I"†<p>Like walking into a dream, Silverymoon stands as a beautiful testament to the lost Myth Drannor. If one could imagine Waterdeep as a prime stag-do location, Silverymoon would be the equivalent of a highbrow cultural city visit. As a centre for knowledge, magic and lore in FaerÃ»n, much of the joy of the city is in pottering around itâ€™s cobbled streets admiring its glimmering towers, and visiting the numerous libraries and museums of the town. Fochlucan College has its home here, and is worth setting aside an afternoon to walk the halls. Many notable Bards have graced this college, and the library itself is a vast treasure trove.</p>
