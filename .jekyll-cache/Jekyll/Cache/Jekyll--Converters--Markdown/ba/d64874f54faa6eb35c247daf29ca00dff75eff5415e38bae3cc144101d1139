You are such an annoyance of a man,
Feywind, Feywind, Feywind, Feywind
Can you cast Fireball? I doubt that you canâ€¦</p>

<p>A hirsute man in robes, I guess?
Aaaand - I cannot recall the rest
A tale or two, Iâ€™m sure, youâ€™ve clearly spinned.<br />
Youâ€™ve been a prick, youâ€™ve made us small
You never do a thing at all,
I literally canâ€™t deal with you Feywind.</p>

<p>We rescued you from Hag-based sleep,
By Torm! your moves are fucking weak,
But I know youâ€™re valued for your skills, Feywind.<br />
I cannot say I understand,
Why you must have your spells â€˜at hand,â€™
I recall mine from memory, Feywindâ€¦</p>

<p>Feywind, Feywind, Feywind, Feywind
Is winemaking a good retirement plan?
Feywind, Feywind, Feywind, Feywind
Can you shoot arrows? I doubt that you canâ€¦</p>

<p>You truly are a cocky shit,
You could have toned it down a bit,
But Barraâ€™s eyes grew large and then he grinned.<br />
Iâ€™d love to say I told you so,
But oops, I didnâ€™t: there you go!
Enjoy that broken nose, humble Feywind!</p>

<p>Feywind, Feywind, Feywind, Feywind
You must have something going for you, man.
Feywind, Feywind, Feywind, Feywind
Can you lift horses? I doubt that you canâ€¦</p>

<p>Feywind, Get binned.</p>
