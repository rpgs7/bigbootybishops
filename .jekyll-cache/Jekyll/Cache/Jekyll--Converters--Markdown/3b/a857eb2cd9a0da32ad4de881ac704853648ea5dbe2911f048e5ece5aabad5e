<p>The embodiment of terror. Been around as long as Bren, but hasnâ€™t lost her scary factor. I mean, we had a visitor in our home, albeit somewhat late, and she wanted to tie him up and kill him. No questions asked. Sure, he turned out to be evil and part of the Night Parade so an absolute solid read, but still - scary.
When I woke up next to her after the celebrations in Kvaldir, I thought I was a dead man, thankfully nothing had happened and I lived to (never) tell the tale.</p>
