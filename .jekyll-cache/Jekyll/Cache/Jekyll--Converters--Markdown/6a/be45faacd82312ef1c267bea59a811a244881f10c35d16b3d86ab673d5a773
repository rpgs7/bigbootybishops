I"<p>Ah, well, what introduction does one need to the City of Splendours?! The spirling northern metropolis is home to over 130,000 people (only, perhaps, half of which are shady), which means there is much adventure to be had for humble homebodies and budding adventurers alike! As well as being able to cater to every form of <em>ahem</em> pleasure and delight available, due to its vast size Waterdeep can also manage to cater to almost every budget imaginable - very helpful for those parties not quite as accomplished as others.</p>
