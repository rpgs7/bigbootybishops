I"k<p>Supposedly named for elite leather gloves of ungodly power, Kvaldir is a quaint yet sizeable trading town, nestled in the shadow of Inara’s Peak. If you want a taste of the ‘real life’ the denizen’s of Kvaldir are the truest, most hardy folk you are likely to meet in the North. 
As with all town’s in this region, the heart of Kvaldir is most certainly its local tavern, the ‘Bitter Bug Bear Inn’. Excellent (if a little drafty) rooms, ale on tap and the single best place to pick-up the hottest dance trends sweeping the Sword’s Coast. An unmissable stop!
However, Kvaldir is also a wonderful tourism gem in it’s own right with plenty of worthy attractions. The temple of Moradin, overseen by Gilhaern, is a fine example of Dwarven craftsmanship. The temple goers are aloof but welcoming - try and visit during prayer, it is a fabulous experience.</p>
