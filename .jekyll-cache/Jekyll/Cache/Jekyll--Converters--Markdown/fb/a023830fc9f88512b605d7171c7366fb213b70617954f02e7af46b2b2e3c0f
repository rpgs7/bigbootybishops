<p>A noble cleric of Torm! If you are a good soul, heâ€™s a friend, if you are a creature - well, no matter how you feel your soul is you are at risk of a good old fashioned purge. I always thought behind those greying eyes was wisdom, I mean - sure, there isâ€¦ but surely the notion of advertising gruel as a lip-smacking snack cannot come from a wise man?!
He and Tilion are usually the ones to, somewhat, keep Barra in check - a noble task indeed.</p>
