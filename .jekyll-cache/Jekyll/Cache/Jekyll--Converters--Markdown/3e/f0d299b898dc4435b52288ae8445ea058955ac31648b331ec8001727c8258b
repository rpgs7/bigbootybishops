<p>What luck we have to have thisâ€¦ unique individual trailblazing through our adventures. Both our meat shield and our menace. Not the sharpest spoon in the oven but happy to sow chaos and I usually like the fun thatâ€™s left in that chaosâ€™ wake!
Best hope eggs are not in short supply, else Jonathan may be paying you a visit. I wouldnâ€™t worry about that though, youâ€™ll hear him coming a mile off with his new farty boots.</p>
