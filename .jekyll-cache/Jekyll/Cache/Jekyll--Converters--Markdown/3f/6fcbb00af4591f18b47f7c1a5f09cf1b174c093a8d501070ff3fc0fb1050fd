<p>Our dear bard! Dissing rats to death, reciting slam poetry, renditions of â€˜Waterdeepâ€™ and inventing new dance crazes - sheâ€™s always good for entertainment! Unexpectedly seems to have found herself as a â€œsensible oneâ€ of the party.
Something tells me the surprise means she wasnâ€™t always the sensible one in herâ€¦erâ€¦however many years (she hits me when I ask).</p>
