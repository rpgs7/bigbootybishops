I"¸<p>We approach the slain orcs in their camp, noticing their hostage is a human - we assume him friendly. He is in his late twenties / early thirties, with an arm blackened with blood from a deep cut. He appears euqipped to travel the dense forest, but not much more. Barra cuts his bonds and asks him who he is and what heâ€™s doing out here. The man explains he and his friend were venturing in order to meet the druids of the forest.</p>
