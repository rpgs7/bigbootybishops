Normal dungeons too weak for you? Do you want to hone your survival skills? Book up for a two-week 'off-the-grid' Wilderness course with human ranger Ray Mears, and his idiot animal accomplice bear, Grylls. 
Learn how to track through exceedingly difficult terrain, how to piss off potential druids, and train in the art of boxing Orcs. Enquire with Sophia at the Griffyn's Nest Inn for availability and prices.

Full review of the High Forest region coming soon!
