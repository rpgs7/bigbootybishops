Feywind, Feywind, Feywind, Feywind
You are such an annoyance of a man,
Feywind, Feywind, Feywind, Feywind
Can you cast Fireball? I doubt that you can...


A hirsute man in robes, I guess?
Aaaand - I cannot recall the rest
A tale or two, I’m sure, you’ve clearly spinned.  
You’ve been a prick, you’ve made us small
You never do a thing at all,
I literally can’t deal with you Feywind.


We rescued you from Hag-based sleep,
By Torm! your moves are fucking weak,
But I know you’re valued for your skills, Feywind.  
I cannot say I understand,
Why you must have your spells ‘at hand,'
I recall mine from memory, Feywind...


Feywind, Feywind, Feywind, Feywind
Is winemaking a good retirement plan?
Feywind, Feywind, Feywind, Feywind
Can you shoot arrows? I doubt that you can...


You truly are a cocky shit,
You could have toned it down a bit,
But Barra’s eyes grew large and then he grinned.  
I’d love to say I told you so,
But oops, I didn’t: there you go!
Enjoy that broken nose, humble Feywind!


Feywind, Feywind, Feywind, Feywind
You must have something going for you, man.
Feywind, Feywind, Feywind, Feywind
Can you lift horses? I doubt that you can...

Feywind, Get binned.
