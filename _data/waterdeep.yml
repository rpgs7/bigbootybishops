- name: Fluhn Bragmar (?)
  description: Volo's assumed lover, whom we saved from the clutches of the Xanathar's guild, after a case of mistaken identity, for a payment of a derelict (haunted) manor that we now call home.

- name: Reynar Neverember (?)
  description: This is who the Xanathar's thought Fluhne was. Likely due to his father being the old Open Lord of Waterdeep, that ran off with 500,000g. The jackpot.

- name: Olaf
  description: My old best friend. I grew up with him when I got to Waterdeep. We always said we'd never join the Xanathar's guild; that they were a step too far. And yet he has, citing his mothers illness whilst threatening us to get out of town.

- name: Xoblob
  description: An old little chap with an odd little store. Got us a book on ciphers we need to return, and a petrified mouse that just won't quit.

- name: Maxime [DECEASED]
  description: A talking mare! Not a mayor! By the time we realised this, it was perhaps too late. The Harpers wanted us to find out the intel that Maxime knew about a Zentharim agent, named the Red Wizard?
