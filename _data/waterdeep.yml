- name: Durnan
  description: Former adventurer that owns The Yawning Portal. 

- name: Fluhn Bragmar (?)
  description: Volo's assumed lover, whom we saved from the clutches of the Xanathar's guild, after a case of mistaken identity, for a payment of a derelict (haunted) manor that we now call home.

- name: Reynar Neverember (?)
  description: This is who the Xanathar's thought Fluhne was. Likely due to his father being the old Open Lord of Waterdeep, that ran off with 500,000g. The jackpot.

- name: Olaf
  description: My old best friend. I grew up with him when I got to Waterdeep. We always said we'd never join the Xanathar's guild; that they were a step too far. And yet he has, citing his mothers illness whilst threatening us to get out of town.

- name: Brian
  description: The Swordmaster's Smithy! A good man with good blades and armour at good prices. Brian is just jolly good.

- name: Xoblob
  description: An old little chap with an odd little store. Got us a book on ciphers we need to return, and a petrified mouse that just won't quit.

- name: Thorgan Gorgad (?)
  description: Wine merchant with portals to pocket dimensions - a friend worth having!

- name: Maxime [DECEASED]
  description: A talking mare! Not a mayor! By the time we realised this, it was perhaps too late. The Harpers wanted us to find out the intel that Maxime knew about a Zhentarim agent, named the Red Wizard?

- name: Jakob Helmfoot
  description: Poor wee bastard that Barra's...alter ego...terrorised, likely leading us to leave Waterdeep to lay low.

- name: Pierce
  description: Our last lead in the case of the talking mare, he worked for Jakob and was noted to be with Maxime when she never returned...

- name: The Black Viper
  description: An infamous thief returned? Story goes The Black Viper was around fifty years back, and thought to be a sister in the Cassalantern family - though they are a noble human family, timeline might not stack up. Rumoured to have suffered a burn on her face and wears a mask to conceal it.

- name: Amalia Cassalantern
  description: Rumoured sister of The Black Viper; still to go knocking on their door...

- name: Yaggra Stonefist
  description: Half orc lady that has been rubbed the wrong way with the Xanathar's Guild. Helped us with a lead to finding where the Xanathar's took Fluhne - the sewers!

- name: Jallister
  description: Friend of Yaggra, a handsome chap.

- name: Simon
  description: Door.

- name: Dorren
  description: Interior decorator who did a stand up job of Trollskull manor!

- name: Oscar Windflower
  description: Carpenter's guild fellow who helped us get Trollskull manor back into its glory days.

- name: Gaxly Rudderbust
  description: Editor of the Waterdeep Wazoo - lead suspect in the curious case of 'Who is a prick?'

- name: Simon Sparkly
  description: Tinker? Tailor? Sailor? Spy?

- name: Balthazar
  description: Creepy old fella, long fingernails and looks like a mystic. Offered us 20,000g for the stone - but wouldn't say why he wanted it...

- name: Joran Newmont
  description: Supposedly could have work for us in Waterdeep, so says the unscrupulous mayor of Triboar...

- name: Jonathan
  description: Devil man. Creator of chaos and the end times. Badness. Misery. OH NO.
